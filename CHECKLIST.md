## üéØ Priority Actions

**To see your landing page working:**

1. **Run the dev server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Add at least one hero image:**

   - Download a fashion/lifestyle image
   - Save as `public/images/hero/hero-main.jpg`
   - Refresh the page

3. **Add product images:**

   - Download 8 product photos
   - Save as `public/images/products/product-1.jpg` through `product-8.jpg`

4. **Add gallery images:**
   - Download 5 lifestyle photos
   - Save as `public/images/gallery/gallery-1.jpg` through `gallery-5.jpg`

**Alternative (Quickest Test):**

Run the dev server without images - you'll see the layout structure with gray placeholders, which is perfect for reviewing the design implementation!
